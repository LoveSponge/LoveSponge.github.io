 <div class="history">
  <h3>A brief history</h3>
  <p>
   Obama was born in Hawaii, 1961, (two years after the territory became Americas 50th state). Obama also spent one year of
   his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked
   as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president
   of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, and taught constitutional
   law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in
   the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with
   his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide
   November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after
   a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January
   20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.

  <h3>Foriegn Policy</h3>
  <p>
   In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made separate overseas
   trips to announce a "new era" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms "break" and "reset" to
   signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by
   granting his first interview to an Arab cable TV network, Al Arabiya.
